        "## Features\n",
        "- Optimized for maximum GPU utilization (works with any available GPU memory)\n",
        "- Video segment selection for processing specific portions of longer videos\n",
        "- Upload videos (up to 500MB) or provide video URLs\n",
        "- Adjustable depth parameters (intensity, convergence, eye separation)\n",
        "- High-quality H.264 encoded MP4 output in SBS format with 16:9 overall aspect ratio\n",
        "- **Preserves original audio track** in the output video\n",

        "1. **GPU Memory Errors**: If you encounter CUDA out of memory errors:\n",
        "   - Use the segment feature to process smaller portions of the video\n",

        "   - Process a shorter or lower resolution video\n",

        "3. **Quality Issues**: The quality of the 3D effect depends on the input video quality and the accuracy of the depth map. Videos with clear objects and good lighting work best.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Processing Speed**: Even with GPU acceleration, depth estimation is computationally intensive. Processing time depends on video length, resolution, and available GPU resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **View Distance**: If objects appear too close or too far in the 3D output, adjust the Convergence Distance parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Eye Strain**: If the 3D effect causes discomfort, reduce the Depth Intensity and Eye Separation values for a more comfortable viewing experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **YouTube Downloads**: If YouTube downloads fail, try using a different web browser to copy a direct video URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Runtime Disconnections**: For long videos, Colab might disconnect. Use the segment feature to process the video in chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Video Conversion**: If video conversion seems stuck, try restarting the notebook and using a smaller video segment.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Maximizing GPU Usage**: This version attempts to use the full capacity of your GPU. You can monitor GPU usage in Colab using the command: `!nvidia-smi` in a new cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Processing Segments**: For videos longer than a few minutes, it's recommended to process them in 1-3 minute segments to avoid Colab timeouts and memory issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Best Results**: For optimal 3D conversion, use videos with:\n",
        "   - Clear foreground and background separation\n",
        "   - Good lighting conditions\n",
        "   - Minimal fast camera movement\n",
        "   - Higher resolution (1080p or above)"
